    """Evaluate a Python expression as a string using various backends.

    The following arithmetic operations are supported: +, -, *, /, **, %, //
    (python engine only) along with the following boolean operations: | (or), &
    (and), and ~ (not). All Pandas objects are supported and behave as they
    would with in-Python evaluation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    expr : string or Expr object
        The expression to evaluate. This can be either a string or an ``Expr``
        object.
    engine : string, optional, default 'numexpr', {'python', 'numexpr', 'pytables'}
        The engine used to evaluate the expression. Supported engines are

        - 'numexpr': This default engine evaluates pandas objects using numexpr
                     for large speed ups in complex expressions with large
                     frames.
        - 'python': Performs operations as if you had eval'd in top level
                    python
        - 'pytables': Engine used for evaluating expressions for selection of
                      objects from PyTables HDF5 tables.

    truediv : bool, optional, default True
        Whether to use true division, like in Python >= 3
    local_dict : dict or None, optional, default None
        A dictionary of local variables, taken from locals() by default.
    global_dict : dict or None, optional, default None
        A dictionary of global variables, taken from globals() by default.

    Returns
    -------
    obj : ndarray, scalar, DataFrame, Series, or Panel

    Notes
    -----
    * The benefits of using ``eval`` are that very large frames that are terms in
      long expressions are sped up, sometimes by as much as 10x.

    See :ref:`Enhancing performance <enhancingperf.eval>` for more details.
