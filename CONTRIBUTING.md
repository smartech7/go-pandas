Guidelines
---

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvments,
enhancements and ideas are welcome.

The Github "issues" tab contains some issues labels "Good as first PR", these are
tasks which do not require deep knowledge of the package. Look those up if you're
looking for a quick way to help out.

Please try and follow these guidelines, as this makes it easier for us to accept
your contribution or address the issue you're having.

- When submitting a bug report:
  - Please include a short, self-contained python snippet.
  - Specify the pandas version used. (you can check `pandas.__version__`).
  - Explain what the expected behavior was, and what you saw instead.

- When submitting a Pull Request
  - **Make sure the test suite passes**., and that means on python3 as well.
    You can use "test_fast.sh", or tox locally and/or enable Travis-CI on your fork.
  - We suggest you enable Travis-CI on your fork, to make it easier for the team
     to see that the PR does indeed pass all the tests.
  - Back-compatiblitiy **really** matters. Pandas already has a large user-base and
    a lot of existing user code. Don't break old code if you can avoid it
    Explain the need if there is one in the PR. 
    Changes to method signatures should be made in a way which doesn't break existing 
    code, for example you should beware of changes to ordering and naming of keyword 
    arguments. Add deprecation warnings when needed.   
  - Performance matters. You can use the included "test_perf.sh"
    script to make sure your PR does not introduce any performance regressions
    in the library.
  - **Don't** merge upstream into a branch you're going to submit as a PR,
    This can create all sorts of problems. Use "git rebase" instead. This ensures
    no merge conflicts occur when you're code is merged by the core team.
  - An informal commit message format is in effect for the project, please try
    and adhere to it. Use a "ENH: ", "TST:", "BUG:", "DOC:", etc' prefix in
    your commit title. Check the output of "git log" for examples.
  - RELEASE.rst and doc/source/vx.y.z.txt contain an on-going changelog for each
    release as it is worked on. Add entries to these files as needed in
    a separate commit in your PR, documenting the fix, enhancement or (unavoidable)
    breaking change.
  - For extra brownie points, use "git rebase -i" to squash and reorder
    commits in your PR so that the history makes the most sense. Use your own
    judgment to decide what history needs to be preserved.
  - On the subject of [PEP8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/): yes.
  - On the subject of massive PEP8 fix PRs touching everything, please consider the following:
    - They create merge conflicts for people working in their own fork.
    - They makes git blame less effective.
    - Different tools / people achieve PEP8 in different styles. This can create
      "style wars" and churn that produces little real benefit.
    - If your code changes are intermixed with style fixes, they are harder to review
      before merging. Keep style fixes in separate commits.
    - it's fine to clean-up a little around an area you just worked on.

    Having said that, if you still feel a PEP8 storm is in order, go for it.

Please see [Developers](http://pandas.pydata.org/developers.html) page on
the project website for more details.
