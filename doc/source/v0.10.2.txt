.. _whatsnew_0102:

v0.10.2 (February ??, 2013)
---------------------------

This is a minor release from 0.10.1 and includes many new features and
enhancements along with a large number of bug fixes. There are also a number of
important API changes that long-time pandas users should pay close attention
to.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Datetime64[ns] columns in a DataFrame (or a Series) allow the use of ``np.nan`` to indicate a nan value, in addition to the traditional ``NaT``, or not-a-time. This allows convenient nan setting in a generic way. Furthermore datetime64 columns are created by default, when passed datetimelike objects (*this change was introduced in 0.10.1*)

.. ipython:: python

   df = DataFrame(randn(6,2),date_range('20010102',periods=6),columns=['A','B'])
   df['timestamp'] = Timestamp('20010103')
   df

   # datetime64[ns] out of the box
   df.get_dtype_counts()

   # use the traditional nan, which is mapped to NaT internally
   df.ix[2:4,['A','timestamp']] = np.nan
   df

Astype conversion on datetime64[ns] to object, implicity converts ``NaT`` to ``np.nan``


.. ipython:: python

   import datetime
   s = Series([datetime.datetime(2001, 1, 2, 0, 0) for i in range(3)])
   s.dtype
   s[1] = np.nan
   s
   s.dtype
   s = s.astype('O')
   s
   s.dtype
