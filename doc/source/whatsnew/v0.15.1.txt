Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added option to select columns when importing Stata files (:issue:`7935`)
- Qualify memory usage in ``DataFrame.info()`` by adding ``+`` if it is a lower bound (:issue:`8578`)
- Added support for 3-character ISO and non-standard country codes in :func:``io.wb.download()`` (:issue:`8482`)
- :ref:`World Bank data requests <remote_data.wb>` now raise Warnings and ValueErrors based on an ``errors`` argument, as well as a list of hard-coded country codes and the World Bank's JSON response.  In prior versions, the error messages didn't look at the World Bank's JSON response.  Problem-inducing input were simply dropped prior to the request.  The issue was that many good countries were cropped in the hard-coded approach.  All countries will work now, but some bad countries will raise exceptions because some edge cases break the entire response.
