Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed issue with dataframe scatter plot for categorical data that reports incorrect column key not found when categorical data is used for plotting (:issue:`16199`)




Conversion
^^^^^^^^^^

- Bug in pickle compat prior to the v0.20.x series, when ``UTC`` is a timezone in a Series/DataFrame/Index (:issue:`16608`)
- Bug in Series construction when passing a Series with ``dtype='category'`` (:issue:`16524`).

Indexing
^^^^^^^^

- Bug in ``Float64Index`` causing an empty array instead of None to be returned from ``.get(np.nan)`` on a Series whose index did not contain any NaNs (:issue:`8569`)

I/O
^^^

-- Bug in ``pd.read_csv()`` in which files weren't opened as binary files by the C engine on Windows, causing EOF characters mid-field, which would fail (:issue:`16039`, :issue:`16559`, :issue`16675`)
