Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed issue with dataframe scatter plot for categorical data that reports incorrect column key not found when categorical data is used for plotting (:issue:`16199`)
- Fixed a pytest marker failing downstream packages' tests suites (:issue:`16680`)



Conversion
^^^^^^^^^^

- Bug in pickle compat prior to the v0.20.x series, when ``UTC`` is a timezone in a Series/DataFrame/Index (:issue:`16608`)
- Bug in Series construction when passing a Series with ``dtype='category'`` (:issue:`16524`).

Indexing
^^^^^^^^

- Bug in ``Float64Index`` causing an empty array instead of ``None`` to be returned from ``.get(np.nan)`` on a Series whose index did not contain any ``NaN`` s (:issue:`8569`)

I/O
^^^

- Bug in :func:`read_csv`` in which files weren't opened as binary files by the C engine on Windows, causing EOF characters mid-field, which would fail (:issue:`16039`, :issue:`16559`, :issue:`16675`)
- Bug in :func:`read_hdf`` in which reading a ``Series`` saved to an HDF file in 'fixed' format fails when an explicit ``mode='r'`` argument is supplied (:issue:`16583`)

Plotting
^^^^^^^^
- Fix regression in series plotting that prevented RGB and RGBA tuples from being used as color arguments (:issue:`16233`)
