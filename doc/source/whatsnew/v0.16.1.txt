Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``StringMethods.capitalize()`` and ``swapcase`` which behave as the same as standard ``str`` (:issue:`9766`)
- Added ``StringMethods`` (.str accessor) to ``Index`` (:issue:`9068`)

  The `.str` accessor is now available for both `Series` and `Index`.

  .. ipython:: python

     idx = Index([' jack', 'jill ', ' jesse ', 'frank'])
     idx.str.strip()

  One special case for the `.str` accessor on `Index` is that if a string method returns `bool`, the `.str` accessor
  will return a `np.array` instead of a boolean `Index` (:issue:`8875`). This enables the following expression
  to work naturally:

  .. ipython:: python

     idx = Index(['a1', 'a2', 'b1', 'b2'])
     s = Series(range(4), index=idx)
     s
     idx.str.startswith('a')
     s[s.index.str.startswith('a')]

- ``DataFrame.mask()`` and ``Series.mask()`` now support same keywords as ``where`` (:issue:`8801`)
- ``drop`` function can now accept ``errors`` keyword to suppress ValueError raised when any of label does not exist in the target data. (:issue:`6736`)

  .. ipython:: python

    df = DataFrame(np.random.randn(3, 3), columns=['A', 'B', 'C'])
    df.drop(['A', 'X'], axis=1, errors='ignore')

- Allow conversion of values with dtype ``datetime64`` or ``timedelta64`` to strings using ``astype(str)`` (:issue:`9757`)
- ``get_dummies`` function now accepts ``sparse`` keyword.  If set to ``True``, the return ``DataFrame`` is sparse, e.g. ``SparseDataFrame``. (:issue:`8823`)
- ``Period`` now accepts ``datetime64`` as value input. (:issue:`9054`)

- Allow timedelta string conversion when leading zero is missing from time definition, ie `0:00:00` vs `00:00:00`. (:issue:`9570`)
- Allow Panel.shift with ``axis='items'`` (:issue:`9890`)

.. _whatsnew_0161.api:

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~





- When passing in an ax to ``df.plot( ..., ax=ax)``, the `sharex` kwarg will now default to `False`.
  The result is that the visibility of xlabels and xticklabels will not anymore be changed. You
  have to do that by yourself for the right axes in your figure or set ``sharex=True`` explicitly
  (but this changes the visible for all axes in the figure, not only the one which is passed in!).
  If pandas creates the subplots itself (e.g. no passed in `ax` kwarg), then the
  default is still ``sharex=True`` and the visibility changes are applied.



- Add support for separating years and quarters using dashes, for
  example 2014-Q1.  (:issue:`9688`)

- :meth:`~pandas.DataFrame.assign` now inserts new columns in alphabetical order. Previously
  the order was arbitrary. (:issue:`9777`)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed bug (:issue:`9542`) where labels did not appear properly in legend of ``DataFrame.plot()``. Passing ``label=`` args also now works, and series indices are no longer mutated.
- Bug in json serialization when frame has length zero.(:issue:`9805`)
- Bug in `read_csv` where missing trailing delimiters would cause segfault. (:issue:`5664`)
- Bug in retaining index name on appending (:issue:`9862`)
- Bug in ``scatter_matrix`` draws unexpected axis ticklabels (:issue:`5662`)
- Fixed bug in ``StataWriter`` resulting in changes to input ``DataFrame`` upon save (:issue:`9795`).
- Bug in ``transform`` causing length mismatch when null entries were present and a fast aggregator was being used (:issue:`9697`)
- Bug in ``equals`` causing false negatives when block order differed (:issue:`9330`)
- Bug in ``read_sql_table`` error when reading postgres table with timezone (:issue:`7139`)
- Bug in ``DataFrame`` slicing may not retain metadata (:issue:`9776`)
- Bug where ``TimdeltaIndex`` were not properly serialized in fixed ``HDFStore`` (:issue:`9635`)
- Bug in plotting continuously using ``secondary_y`` may not show legend properly. (:issue:`9610`, :issue:`9779`)
- Bug in ``DataFrame.plot(kind="hist")`` results in ``TypeError`` when ``DataFrame`` contains non-numeric columns  (:issue:`9853`)
- Bug where repeated plotting of ``DataFrame`` with a ``DatetimeIndex`` may raise ``TypeError`` (:issue:`9852`)
- Bug in ``setup.py`` that would allow an incompat cython version to build (:issue:`9827`)
- Bug in plotting ``secondary_y`` incorrectly attaches ``right_ax`` property to secondary axes specifying itself recursively. (:issue:`9861`)

- Bug in ``Series.quantile`` on empty Series of type ``Datetime`` or ``Timedelta`` (:issue:`9675`)
- Bug in ``where`` causing incorrect results when upcasting was required (:issue:`9731`)
- Bug in ``FloatArrayFormatter`` where decision boundary for displaying "small" floats in decimal format is off by one order of magnitude for a given display.precision (:issue:`9764`)
- Fixed bug where ``DataFrame.plot()`` raised an error when both ``color`` and ``style`` keywords were passed and there was no color symbol in the style strings (:issue:`9671`)
- Bug in ``read_csv`` and ``read_table`` when using ``skip_rows`` parameter if blank lines are present. (:issue:`9832`)
- Bug in ``read_csv()`` interprets ``index_col=True`` as ``1`` (:issue:`9798`)
- Bug in index equality comparisons using ``==`` failing on Index/MultiIndex type incompatibility (:issue:`9875`)
- Bug in which ``SparseDataFrame`` could not take `nan` as a column name (:issue:`8822`)
- Bug in ``to_msgpack`` and ``read_msgpack`` zlib and blosc compression support (:issue:`9783`)
- Bug in unequal comparisons between a ``Series`` of dtype `"category"` and a scalar (e.g. ``Series(Categorical(list("abc"), categories=list("cba"), ordered=True)) > "b"``, which wouldn't use the order of the categories but use the lexicographical order. (:issue:`9848`)
















- Bug in unequal comparisons between categorical data and a scalar, which was not in the categories (e.g. ``Series(Categorical(list("abc"), ordered=True)) > "d"``. This returned ``False`` for all elements, but now raises a ``TypeError``. Equality comparisons also now return ``False`` for ``==`` and ``True`` for ``!=``. (:issue:`9848`)

- Bug in DataFrame ``__setitem__`` when right hand side is a dictionary (:issue:`9874`)
- Bug in ``where`` when dtype is ``datetime64/timedelta64``, but dtype of other is not (:issue:`9804`)
- Bug in ``MultiIndex.sortlevel()`` results in unicode level name breaks (:issue:`9875`)
- Bug in which ``groupby.transform`` incorrectly enforced output dtypes to match input dtypes. (:issue:`9807`)

- Bug in bar plot with ``log=True`` raises ``TypeError`` if all values are less than 1 (:issue:`9905`)
- Bug in horizontal bar plot ignores ``log=True`` (:issue:`9905`)








- Bug where dividing a dataframe containing values of type ``Decimal`` by another ``Decimal`` would raise. (:issue:`9787`)
- Bug where using DataFrames asfreq would remove the name of the index. (:issue:`9885`)
- Changed caching in ``AbstractHolidayCalendar`` to be at the instance level rather than at the class level as the latter can result in unexpected behaviour. (:issue:`9552`)

- Fixed latex output for multi-indexed dataframes (:issue:`9778`)
