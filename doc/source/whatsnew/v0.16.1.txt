.. _whatsnew_0161.enhancements:

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``StringMethods.capitalize()`` and ``swapcase`` which behave as the same as standard ``str`` (:issue:`9766`)

- ``DataFrame.mask()`` and ``Series.mask()`` now support same keywords as ``where`` (:issue:`8801`)




.. _whatsnew_0161.api:

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~





- When passing in an ax to ``df.plot( ..., ax=ax)``, the `sharex` kwarg will now default to `False`.
  The result is that the visibility of xlabels and xticklabels will not anymore be changed. You
  have to do that by yourself for the right axes in your figure or set ``sharex=True`` explicitly
  (but this changes the visible for all axes in the figure, not only the one which is passed in!).
  If pandas creates the subplots itself (e.g. no passed in `ax` kwarg), then the
  default is still ``sharex=True`` and the visibility changes are applied.



- Add support for separating years and quarters using dashes, for
  example 2014-Q1.  (:issue:`9688`)

Performance Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~






.. _whatsnew_0161.bug_fixes:

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed bug (:issue:`9542`) where labels did not appear properly in legend of ``DataFrame.plot()``. Passing ``label=`` args also now works, and series indices are no longer mutated.
- Bug in json serialization when frame has length zero.(:issue:`9805`)


- Bug in ``scatter_matrix`` draws unexpected axis ticklabels (:issue:`5662`)




- Bug in ``transform`` causing length mismatch when null entries were present and a fast aggregator was being used (:issue:`9697`)

- Bug in ``equals`` causing false negatives when block order differed (:issue:`9330`)

- Bug in ``DataFrame`` slicing may not retain metadata (:issue:`9776`)
- Bug where ``TimdeltaIndex`` were not properly serialized in fixed ``HDFStore`` (:issue:`9635`)

- Bug in plotting continuously using ``secondary_y`` may not show legend properly. (:issue:`9610`, :issue:`9779`)


- Bug in ``Series.quantile`` on empty Series of type ``Datetime`` or ``Timedelta`` (:issue:`9675`)
- Bug in ``where`` causing incorrect results when upcasting was required (:issue:`9731`)
