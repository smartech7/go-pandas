v0.10.0 (December ??, 2012)
---------------------------

This is a major release from 0.9.1 and includes several new features and
enhancements along with a large number of bug fixes.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~


API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

  - ``Series.apply`` will now operate on a returned value from the applied function, that is itself a series, and possibly upcast the result to a DataFrame

    .. ipython:: python

        def f(x):
	   return Series([ x, x**2 ], index = ['x', 'x^s'])
        s = Series(np.random.rand(5))
	s
        s.apply(f)

    This is conceptually similar to the following.

    .. ipython:: python

       concat([ f(y) for x, y in s.iteritems() ], axis=1).T
