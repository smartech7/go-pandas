API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior Version Deprecations/Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These were announced changes in 0.13 or prior that are taking effect as of 0.13.1

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Panel.apply`` will work on non-ufuncs. See :ref:`the docs<basics.apply_panel>`.

  .. ipython:: python

     import pandas.util.testing as tm
     panel = tm.makePanel(5)
     panel
     panel['ItemA']

  Specifying an ``apply`` that operates on a Series (to return a single element)

  .. ipython:: python

     panel.apply(lambda x: x.dtype, axis='items')

  A similar reduction type operation

  .. ipython:: python

     panel.apply(lambda x: x.sum(), axis='major_axis')

  This is equivalent to

  .. ipython:: python

     panel.sum('major_axis')

  A transformation operation that returns a Panel, but is computing
  the z-score across the major_axis

  .. ipython:: python

     result = panel.apply(lambda x: (x-x.mean())/x.std(), axis='major_axis')
     result
     result['ItemA']

- ``Panel.apply`` operating on cross-sectional slabs. (:issue:`1148`)

  .. ipython:: python

     f = lambda x: (x-x.mean(1)/x.std(1))

     result = panel.apply(f, axis = ['items','major_axis'])
     result
     result.loc[:,:,'ItemA']

  This is equivalent to the following

  .. ipython:: python

     result = Panel(dict([ (ax,f(panel.loc[:,:,ax])) for ax in panel.minor_axis ]))
     result
     result.loc[:,:,'ItemA']
