v0.14.0 (May ? , 2014)
----------------------

This is a major release from 0.13.1 and includes a small number of API changes, several new features,
enhancements, and performance improvements along with a large number of bug fixes. We recommend that all
users upgrade to this version.

Highlights include:

-


API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``iloc`` will now accept out-of-bounds indexers, e.g. a value that exceeds the length of the object being
  indexed. These will be excluded. This will make pandas conform more with pandas/numpy indexing of out-of-bounds
  values. A single indexer that is out-of-bounds and drops the dimensions of the object will still raise
  ``IndexError`` (:issue:`6296`). This could result in an empty axis (e.g. an empty DataFrame being returned)

  .. ipython:: python

      df = DataFrame(np.random.randn(5,2),columns=list('AB'))
      df
      df.iloc[[4,5,6]]
      df.iloc[4:6]
      df.iloc[:,2:3]
      df.iloc[:,1:3]
