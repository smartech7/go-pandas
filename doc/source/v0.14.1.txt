API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Openpyxl now raises a ValueError on construction of the openpyxl writer
  instead of warning on pandas import (:issue:`7284`).

- For ``StringMethods.extract``, when no match is found, the result - only
  containing ``NaN`` values - now also has ``dtype=object`` instead of
  ``float`` (:issue:`7242`)

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Tests for basic reading of public S3 buckets now exist (:issue:`7281`).
- ``read_html`` now sports an ``encoding`` argument that is passed to the
  underlying parser library. You can use this to read non-ascii encoded web
  pages (:issue:`7323`).

- Support for dateutil timezones, which can now be used in the same way as
  pytz timezones across pandas. (:issue:`4688`)

   rng_utc_dateutil = date_range('3/6/2012 00:00', periods=10, freq='D',
                                 tz='dateutil/UTC')
   rng_utc_dateutil.tz

  See :ref:`the docs <timeseries.timezone>`.

- Implemented ``sem`` (standard error of the mean) operation for ``Series``,
  ``DataFrame``, ``Panel``, and ``Groupby`` (:issue:`6897`)

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improvements in dtype inference for numeric operations involving yielding performance gains
for dtypes: ``int64``, ``timedelta64``, ``datetime64`` (:issue:`7223`)

~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no experimental changes in 0.14.1
