v0.9.0 (September 25, 2012)
------------------------

This is a major release from 0.8.1 and includes several new features and
enhancements along with a large number of bug fixes. New features include
vectorized unicode encoding/decoding for `Series.str`, `to_latex` method to
DataFrame, more flexible parsing of boolean values, and enabling downloading
options data from Yahoo! Finance.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Add ``str.encode`` and ``str.decode`` for unicode handling to
    :ref:`vectorized string processing methods <basics.string_methods>`
	in Series  (GH1706_)
  - Add `DataFrame.to_latex` method (GH1735_)
  - Add convenient expanding window equivalents of all rolling_* ops (GH1785_)
  - Add Options class to pandas.io.data for fetching options data from Yahoo!
    Finance (GH1748_, GH1739_)
  - More flexible text parsing of boolean values (Yes, No, TRUE,
    FALSE, and variants thereof) (GH1691_, GH1295_)

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Deprecated ``day_of_year`` API removed from PeriodIndex, use ``dayofyear``
    (GH1723_)
  - Don't modify NumPy suppress printoption at import time
  - The internal HDF5 data arrangement for DataFrames has been
    transposed. Legacy files will still be readable by HDFStore
	(GH1834_, GH1824_)
  - Legacy cruft removed: pandas.stats.misc.quantileTS
  - Use ISO8601 format for Period repr: monthly, daily, and on down (GH1776_)
  - Empty DataFrame columns are now created as object dtype. This will prevent
    a class of TypeErrors that was occurring in code where the dtype of a
    column would depend on the presence of data or not (e.g. a SQL query having
    results) (GH1783_)
  - Setting parts of DataFrame/Panel using ix now aligns input Series/DataFrame
    (GH1630_)
  - `first` and `last` methods in `GroupBy` no longer drop non-numeric columns
    (GH1809_)
  - Resolved inconsistencies in specifying custom NA values in text parser.
    `na_values` of type dict no longer override default NAs unless
    `keep_default_na` is set to false explicitly (GH1657_)
