Release Notes
=============

This is the list of changes to pandas between each release. For full details,
see the commit logs at http://github.com/pydata/pandas

What is it
----------

pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both
easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the
broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data
analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.

**API Changes**

  - Change default header names in read_* functions to more Pythonic X0, X1,
    etc. instead of X.1, X.2. (#2000)

    #507, various pull requests)

pandas 0.5.0
============

**Release date:** 10/24/2011

This release of pandas includes a number of API changes (see below) and cleanup
of deprecated APIs from pre-0.4.0 releases. There are also bug fixes, new
features, numerous significant performance enhancements, and includes a new
IPython completer hook to enable tab completion of DataFrame columns accesses
as attributes (a new feature).

In addition to the changes listed here from 0.4.3 to 0.5.0, the minor releases
0.4.1, 0.4.2, and 0.4.3 brought some significant new functionality and
performance improvements that are worth taking a look at.

Thanks to all for bug reports, contributed patches and generally providing
feedback on the library.

**API Changes**

  - `read_table`, `read_csv`, and `ExcelFile.parse` default arguments for
    `index_col` is now None. To use one or more of the columns as the resulting
    DataFrame's index, these must be explicitly specified now
  - Parsing functions like `read_csv` no longer parse dates by default (GH
    #225)
  - Removed `weights` option in panel regression which was not doing anything
    principled (GH #155)
  - Changed `buffer` argument name in `Series.to_string` to `buf`
  - `Series.to_string` and `DataFrame.to_string` now return strings by default
    instead of printing to sys.stdout
  - Deprecated `nanRep` argument in various `to_string` and `to_csv` functions
    in favor of `na_rep`. Will be removed in 0.6 (GH #275)
  - Renamed `delimiter` to `sep` in `DataFrame.from_csv` for consistency
  - Changed order of `Series.clip` arguments to match those of `numpy.clip` and
    added (unimplemented) `out` argument so `numpy.clip` can be called on a
    Series (GH #272)
  - Series functions renamed (and thus deprecated) in 0.4 series have been
    removed:

    * `asOf`, use `asof`
    * `toDict`, use `to_dict`
    * `toString`, use `to_string`
    * `toCSV`, use `to_csv`
    * `merge`, use `map`
    * `applymap`, use `apply`
    * `combineFirst`, use `combine_first`
    * `_firstTimeWithValue` use `first_valid_index`
    * `_lastTimeWithValue` use `last_valid_index`

  - DataFrame functions renamed / deprecated in 0.4 series have been removed:

    * `asMatrix` method, use `as_matrix` or `values` attribute
    * `combineFirst`, use `combine_first`
    * `getXS`, use `xs`
    * `merge`, use `join`
    * `fromRecords`, use `from_records`
    * `fromcsv`, use `from_csv`
    * `toRecords`, use `to_records`
    * `toDict`, use `to_dict`
    * `toString`, use `to_string`
    * `toCSV`, use `to_csv`
    * `_firstTimeWithValue` use `first_valid_index`
    * `_lastTimeWithValue` use `last_valid_index`
    * `toDataMatrix` is no longer needed
    * `rows()` method, use `index` attribute
    * `cols()` method, use `columns` attribute
    * `dropEmptyRows()`, use `dropna(how='all')`
    * `dropIncompleteRows()`, use `dropna()`
    * `tapply(f)`, use `apply(f, axis=1)`
    * `tgroupby(keyfunc, aggfunc)`, use `groupby` with `axis=1`

  - Other outstanding deprecations have been removed:

    * `indexField` argument in `DataFrame.from_records`
    * `missingAtEnd` argument in `Series.order`. Use `na_last` instead
    * `Series.fromValue` classmethod, use regular `Series` constructor instead
    * Functions `parseCSV`, `parseText`, and `parseExcel` methods in
      `pandas.io.parsers` have been removed
    * `Index.asOfDate` function
    * `Panel.getMinorXS` (use `minor_xs`) and `Panel.getMajorXS` (use
      `major_xs`)
    * `Panel.toWide`, use `Panel.to_wide` instead

    optionally try to parse dates in the index columns
  - Add `nrows`, `chunksize`, and `iterator` arguments to `read_csv` and

    lazily iterating through chunks of a flat file (GH #242)
  - Added ability to join on multiple columns in `DataFrame.join` (GH #214)
  - Added private `_get_duplicates` function to `Index` for identifying

    `read_table`
  - Added Cython function for converting tuples to ndarray very fast. Speeds up
    many MultiIndex-related operations

    check if a parsed index has duplicates and raise a more helpful exception
    rather than deferring the check until later
  - Refactored merging / joining code into a tidy class and disabled unnecessary
    computations in the float/object case, thus getting about 10% better
    performance (GH #211)
  - Improved speed of `DataFrame.xs` on mixed-type DataFrame objects by about
    5x, regression from 0.3.0 (GH #215)

      representations of integers like 1.0, 2.0, etc.
    - "True"/"False" will not get correctly converted to boolean
    - Index name attribute will get set when specifying an index column
    - Passing column names should force `header=None` (GH #257)
    - Don't modify passed column names when `index_col` is not
      None (GH #258)
    - Can sniff CSV separator in zip file (since seek is not supported, was
      failing before)
  - Worked around matplotlib "bug" in which series[:, np.newaxis] fails. Should
    be reported upstream to matplotlib (GH #224)

pandas 0.4.3
============

Release notes
-------------

**Release date:** 10/9/2011

This is largely a bugfix release from 0.4.2 but also includes a handful of new
and enhanced features. Also, pandas can now be installed and used on Python 3
(thanks Thomas Kluyver!).

**New features / modules**

  - Python 3 support using 2to3 (PR #200, Thomas Kluyver)
  - Add `name` attribute to `Series` and added relevant logic and tests. Name
    now prints as part of `Series.__repr__`
  - Add `name` attribute to standard Index so that stacking / unstacking does
    not discard names and so that indexed DataFrame objects can be reliably
    round-tripped to flat files, pickle, HDF5, etc.
  - Add `isnull` and `notnull` as instance methods on Series (PR #209, GH #203)

**Improvements to existing features**

  - Skip xlrd-related unit tests if not installed
  - `Index.append` and `MultiIndex.append` can accept a list of Index objects to
    concatenate together
  - Altered binary operations on differently-indexed SparseSeries objects to use
    the integer-based (dense) alignment logic which is faster with a larger
    number of blocks (GH #205)
  - Refactored `Series.__repr__` to be a bit more clean and consistent

**API Changes**

  - `Series.describe` and `DataFrame.describe` now bring the 25% and 75%
    quartiles instead of the 10% and 90% deciles. The other outputs have not
    changed
  - `Series.toString` will print deprecation warning, has been de-camelCased to
    `to_string`

**Bug fixes**

  - Fix broken interaction between `Index` and `Int64Index` when calling
    intersection. Implement `Int64Index.intersection`
  - `MultiIndex.sortlevel` discarded the level names (GH #202)
  - Fix bugs in groupby, join, and append due to improper concatenation of
    `MultiIndex` objects (GH #201)
  - Fix regression from 0.4.1, `isnull` and `notnull` ceased to work on other
    kinds of Python scalar objects like `datetime.datetime`
  - Raise more helpful exception when attempting to write empty DataFrame or
    LongPanel to `HDFStore` (GH #204)
  - Use stdlib csv module to properly escape strings with commas in
    `DataFrame.to_csv` (PR #206, Thomas Kluyver)

pandas 0.4.2
============

Release notes
-------------

**Release date:** 10/3/2011

This is a performance optimization release with several bug fixes. The new
Int64Index and new merging / joining Cython code and related Python
infrastructure are the main new additions

**New features / modules**

  - Added fast `Int64Index` type with specialized join, union,
    intersection. Will result in significant performance enhancements for
    int64-based time series (e.g. using NumPy's datetime64 one day) and also
    faster operations on DataFrame objects storing record array-like data.
  - Refactored `Index` classes to have a `join` method and associated data
    alignment routines throughout the codebase to be able to leverage optimized
    joining / merging routines.
  - Added `Series.align` method for aligning two series with choice of join
    method
  - Wrote faster Cython data alignment / merging routines resulting in
    substantial speed increases
  - Added `is_monotonic` property to `Index` classes with associated Cython
    code to evaluate the monotonicity of the `Index` values
  - Add method `get_level_values` to `MultiIndex`
  - Implemented shallow copy of `BlockManager` object in `DataFrame` internals

**Improvements to existing features**

  - Improved performance of `isnull` and `notnull`, a regression from v0.3.0
    (GH #187)
  - Wrote templating / code generation script to auto-generate Cython code for
    various functions which need to be available for the 4 major data types
    used in pandas (float64, bool, object, int64)
  - Refactored code related to `DataFrame.join` so that intermediate aligned
    copies of the data in each `DataFrame` argument do not need to be
    created. Substantial performance increases result (GH #176)
  - Substantially improved performance of generic `Index.intersection` and
    `Index.union`
  - Improved performance of `DateRange.union` with overlapping ranges and
    non-cacheable offsets (like Minute). Implemented analogous fast
    `DateRange.intersection` for overlapping ranges.
  - Implemented `BlockManager.take` resulting in significantly faster `take`
    performance on mixed-type `DataFrame` objects (GH #104)
  - Improved performance of `Series.sort_index`
  - Significant groupby performance enhancement: removed unnecessary integrity
    checks in DataFrame internals that were slowing down slicing operations to
    retrieve groups
  - Added informative Exception when passing dict to DataFrame groupby
    aggregation with axis != 0

**API Changes**

None

**Bug fixes**

  - Fixed minor unhandled exception in Cython code implementing fast groupby
    aggregation operations
  - Fixed bug in unstacking code manifesting with more than 3 hierarchical
    levels
  - Throw exception when step specified in label-based slice (GH #185)
  - Fix isnull to correctly work with np.float32. Fix upstream bug described in
    GH #182
  - Finish implementation of as_index=False in groupby for DataFrame
    aggregation (GH #181)
  - Raise SkipTest for pre-epoch HDFStore failure. Real fix will be sorted out
    via datetime64 dtype

pandas 0.4.1
============

Release notes
-------------

**Release date:** 9/25/2011

This is primarily a bug fix release but includes some new features and
improvements

**New features / modules**

  - Added new `DataFrame` methods `get_dtype_counts` and property `dtypes`
  - Setting of values using ``.ix`` indexing attribute in mixed-type DataFrame
    objects has been implemented (fixes GH #135)
  - `read_csv` can read multiple columns into a `MultiIndex`. DataFrame's
    `to_csv` method will properly write out a `MultiIndex` which can be read
    back (PR #151, thanks to Skipper Seabold)
  - Wrote fast time series merging / joining methods in Cython. Will be
    integrated later into DataFrame.join and related functions
  - Added `ignore_index` option to `DataFrame.append` for combining unindexed
    records stored in a DataFrame

**Improvements to existing features**

  - Some speed enhancements with internal Index type-checking function
  - `DataFrame.rename` has a new `copy` parameter which can rename a DataFrame
    in place
  - Enable unstacking by level name (PR #142)
  - Enable sortlevel to work by level name (PR #141)
  - `read_csv` can automatically "sniff" other kinds of delimiters using
    `csv.Sniffer` (PR #146)
  - Improved speed of unit test suite by about 40%
  - Exception will not be raised calling `HDFStore.remove` on non-existent node
    with where clause
  - Optimized `_ensure_index` function resulting in performance savings in
    type-checking Index objects

**API Changes**

None

**Bug fixes**

  - Fixed DataFrame constructor bug causing downstream problems (e.g. .copy()
    failing) when passing a Series as the values along with a column name and
    index
  - Fixed single-key groupby on DataFrame with as_index=False (GH #160)
  - `Series.shift` was failing on integer Series (GH #154)
  - `unstack` methods were producing incorrect output in the case of duplicate
    hierarchical labels. An exception will now be raised (GH #147)
  - Calling `count` with level argument caused reduceat failure or segfault in
    earlier NumPy (GH #169)
  - Fixed `DataFrame.corrwith` to automatically exclude non-numeric data (GH
    #144)
  - Unicode handling bug fixes in `DataFrame.to_string` (GH #138)
  - Excluding OLS degenerate unit test case that was causing platform specific
    failure (GH #149)
  - Skip blosc-dependent unit tests for PyTables < 2.2 (PR #137)
  - Calling `copy` on `DateRange` did not copy over attributes to the new object
    (GH #168)
  - Fix bug in `HDFStore` in which Panel data could be appended to a Table with
    different item order, thus resulting in an incorrect result read back

pandas 0.4.0
============

Release notes
-------------

**Release date:** 9/12/2011

**New features / modules**

  - `pandas.core.sparse` module: "Sparse" (mostly-NA, or some other fill value)
    versions of `Series`, `DataFrame`, and `Panel`. For low-density data, this
    will result in significant performance boosts, and smaller memory
    footprint. Added `to_sparse` methods to `Series`, `DataFrame`, and
    `Panel`. See online documentation for more on these
  - Fancy indexing operator on Series / DataFrame, e.g. via .ix operator. Both
    getting and setting of values is supported; however, setting values will only
    currently work on homogeneously-typed DataFrame objects. Things like:

    * series.ix[[d1, d2, d3]]
    * frame.ix[5:10, ['C', 'B', 'A']], frame.ix[5:10, 'A':'C']
    * frame.ix[date1:date2]

  - Significantly enhanced `groupby` functionality

    * Can groupby multiple keys, e.g. df.groupby(['key1', 'key2']). Iteration with
      multiple groupings products a flattened tuple
    * "Nuisance" columns (non-aggregatable) will automatically be excluded from
      DataFrame aggregation operations
    * Added automatic "dispatching to Series / DataFrame methods to more easily
      invoke methods on groups. e.g. s.groupby(crit).std() will work even though
      `std` is not implemented on the `GroupBy` class

  - Hierarchical / multi-level indexing

    * New the `MultiIndex` class. Integrated `MultiIndex` into `Series` and
      `DataFrame` fancy indexing, slicing, __getitem__ and __setitem,
      reindexing, etc. Added `level` keyword argument to `groupby` to enable
      grouping by a level of a `MultiIndex`

  - New data reshaping functions: `stack` and `unstack` on DataFrame and Series

    * Integrate with MultiIndex to enable sophisticated reshaping of data

  - `Index` objects (labels for axes) are now capable of holding tuples
  - `Series.describe`, `DataFrame.describe`: produces an R-like table of summary
    statistics about each data column
  - `DataFrame.quantile`, `Series.quantile` for computing sample quantiles of data
    across requested axis
  - Added general `DataFrame.dropna` method to replace `dropIncompleteRows` and
    `dropEmptyRows`, deprecated those.
  - `Series` arithmetic methods with optional fill_value for missing data,
    e.g. a.add(b, fill_value=0). If a location is missing for both it will still
    be missing in the result though.
  - fill_value option has been added to `DataFrame`.{add, mul, sub, div} methods
    similar to `Series`
  - Boolean indexing with `DataFrame` objects: data[data > 0.1] = 0.1 or
    data[data> other] = 1.
  - `pytz` / tzinfo support in `DateRange`

    * `tz_localize`, `tz_normalize`, and `tz_validate` methods added

  - Added `ExcelFile` class to `pandas.io.parsers` for parsing multiple sheets out
    of a single Excel 2003 document
  - `GroupBy` aggregations can now optionally *broadcast*, e.g. produce an object
    of the same size with the aggregated value propagated
  - Added `select` function in all data structures: reindex axis based on
    arbitrary criterion (function returning boolean value),
    e.g. frame.select(lambda x: 'foo' in x, axis=1)
  - `DataFrame.consolidate` method, API function relating to redesigned internals
  - `DataFrame.insert` method for inserting column at a specified location rather
    than the default __setitem__ behavior (which puts it at the end)
  - `HDFStore` class in `pandas.io.pytables` has been largely rewritten using
    patches from Jeff Reback from others. It now supports mixed-type `DataFrame`
    and `Series` data and can store `Panel` objects. It also has the option to
    query `DataFrame` and `Panel` data. Loading data from legacy `HDFStore`
    files is supported explicitly in the code
  - Added `set_printoptions` method to modify appearance of DataFrame tabular
    output
  - `rolling_quantile` functions; a moving version of `Series.quantile` /
    `DataFrame.quantile`
  - Generic `rolling_apply` moving window function
  - New `drop` method added to `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. which can drop a set of
    labels from an axis, producing a new object
  - `reindex` methods now sport a `copy` option so that data is not forced to be
    copied then the resulting object is indexed the same
  - Added `sort_index` methods to Series and Panel. Renamed `DataFrame.sort`
    to `sort_index`. Leaving `DataFrame.sort` for now.
  - Added ``skipna`` option to statistical instance methods on all the data
    structures
  - `pandas.io.data` module providing a consistent interface for reading time
    series data from several different sources

**Improvements to existing features**

  * The 2-dimensional `DataFrame` and `DataMatrix` classes have been extensively
    redesigned internally into a single class `DataFrame`, preserving where
    possible their optimal performance characteristics. This should reduce
    confusion from users about which class to use.

    * Note that under the hood there is a new essentially "lazy evaluation"
      scheme within respect to adding columns to DataFrame. During some
      operations, like-typed blocks will be "consolidated" but not before.

  * `DataFrame` accessing columns repeatedly is now significantly faster than
    `DataMatrix` used to be in 0.3.0 due to an internal Series caching mechanism
    (which are all views on the underlying data)
  * Column ordering for mixed type data is now completely consistent in
    `DataFrame`. In prior releases, there was inconsistent column ordering in
    `DataMatrix`
  * Improved console / string formatting of DataMatrix with negative numbers
  * Improved tabular data parsing functions, `read_table` and `read_csv`:

    * Added `skiprows` and `na_values` arguments to `pandas.io.parsers` functions
      for more flexible IO
    * `parseCSV` / `read_csv` functions and others in `pandas.io.parsers` now can
      take a list of custom NA values, and also a list of rows to skip

  * Can slice `DataFrame` and get a view of the data (when homogeneously typed),
    e.g. frame.xs(idx, copy=False) or frame.ix[idx]
  * Many speed optimizations throughout `Series` and `DataFrame`
  * Eager evaluation of groups when calling ``groupby`` functions, so if there is
    an exception with the grouping function it will raised immediately versus
    sometime later on when the groups are needed
  * `datetools.WeekOfMonth` offset can be parameterized with `n` different than 1
    or -1.
  * Statistical methods on DataFrame like `mean`, `std`, `var`, `skew` will now
    ignore non-numerical data. Before a not very useful error message was
    generated. A flag `numeric_only` has been added to `DataFrame.sum` and
    `DataFrame.count` to enable this behavior in those methods if so desired
    (disabled by default)
  * `DataFrame.pivot` generalized to enable pivoting multiple columns into a
    `DataFrame` with hierarchical columns
  * `DataFrame` constructor can accept structured / record arrays
  * `Panel` constructor can accept a dict of DataFrame-like objects. Do not
    need to use `from_dict` anymore (`from_dict` is there to stay, though).

**API Changes**

  * The `DataMatrix` variable now refers to `DataFrame`, will be removed within
    two releases
  * `WidePanel` is now known as `Panel`. The `WidePanel` variable in the pandas
    namespace now refers to the renamed `Panel` class
  * `LongPanel` and `Panel` / `WidePanel` now no longer have a common
    subclass. `LongPanel` is now a subclass of `DataFrame` having a number of
    additional methods and a hierarchical index instead of the old
    `LongPanelIndex` object, which has been removed. Legacy `LongPanel` pickles
    may not load properly
  * Cython is now required to build `pandas` from a development branch. This was
    done to avoid continuing to check in cythonized C files into source
    control. Builds from released source distributions will not require Cython
  * Cython code has been moved up to a top level `pandas/src` directory. Cython
    extension modules have been renamed and promoted from the `lib` subpackage to
    the top level, i.e.

    * `pandas.lib.tseries` -> `pandas._tseries`
    * `pandas.lib.sparse` -> `pandas._sparse`

  * `DataFrame` pickling format has changed. Backwards compatibility for legacy
    pickles is provided, but it's recommended to consider PyTables-based
    `HDFStore` for storing data with a longer expected shelf life
  * A `copy` argument has been added to the `DataFrame` constructor to avoid
    unnecessary copying of data. Data is no longer copied by default when passed
    into the constructor
  * Handling of boolean dtype in `DataFrame` has been improved to support storage
    of boolean data with NA / NaN values. Before it was being converted to float64
    so this should not (in theory) cause API breakage
  * To optimize performance, Index objects now only check that their labels are
    unique when uniqueness matters (i.e. when someone goes to perform a
    lookup). This is a potentially dangerous tradeoff, but will lead to much
    better performance in many places (like groupby).
  * Boolean indexing using Series must now have the same indices (labels)
  * Backwards compatibility support for begin/end/nPeriods keyword arguments in
    DateRange class has been removed
  * More intuitive / shorter filling aliases `ffill` (for `pad`) and `bfill` (for
    `backfill`) have been added to the functions that use them: `reindex`,
    `asfreq`, `fillna`.
  * `pandas.core.mixins` code moved to `pandas.core.generic`
  * `buffer` keyword arguments (e.g. `DataFrame.toString`) renamed to `buf` to
    avoid using Python built-in name
  * `DataFrame.rows()` removed (use `DataFrame.index`)
  * Added deprecation warning to `DataFrame.cols()`, to be removed in next release
  * `DataFrame` deprecations and de-camelCasing: `merge`, `asMatrix`,
    `toDataMatrix`, `_firstTimeWithValue`, `_lastTimeWithValue`, `toRecords`,
    `fromRecords`, `tgroupby`, `toString`
  * `pandas.io.parsers` method deprecations

    * `parseCSV` is now `read_csv` and keyword arguments have been de-camelCased
    * `parseText` is now `read_table`
    * `parseExcel` is replaced by the `ExcelFile` class and its `parse` method

  * `fillMethod` arguments (deprecated in prior release) removed, should be
    replaced with `method`
  * `Series.fill`, `DataFrame.fill`, and `Panel.fill` removed, use `fillna`
    instead
  * `groupby` functions now exclude NA / NaN values from the list of groups. This
    matches R behavior with NAs in factors e.g. with the `tapply` function
  * Removed `parseText`, `parseCSV` and `parseExcel` from pandas namespace
  * `Series.combineFunc` renamed to `Series.combine` and made a bit more general
    with a `fill_value` keyword argument defaulting to NaN
  * Removed `pandas.core.pytools` module. Code has been moved to
    `pandas.core.common`
  * Tacked on `groupName` attribute for groups in GroupBy renamed to `name`
  * Panel/LongPanel `dims` attribute renamed to `shape` to be more conformant
  * Slicing a `Series` returns a view now
  * More Series deprecations / renaming: `toCSV` to `to_csv`, `asOf` to `asof`,
    `merge` to `map`, `applymap` to `apply`, `toDict` to `to_dict`,
    `combineFirst` to `combine_first`. Will print `FutureWarning`.
  * `DataFrame.to_csv` does not write an "index" column label by default
    anymore since the output file can be read back without it. However, there
    is a new ``index_label`` argument. So you can do ``index_label='index'`` to
    emulate the old behavior
  * `datetools.Week` argument renamed from `dayOfWeek` to `weekday`
  * `timeRule` argument in `shift` has been deprecated in favor of using the
    `offset` argument for everything. So you can still pass a time rule string
    to `offset`
  * Added optional `encoding` argument to `read_csv`, `read_table`, `to_csv`,
    `from_csv` to handle unicode in python 2.x

**Bug fixes**

  * Column ordering in `pandas.io.parsers.parseCSV` will match CSV in the presence
    of mixed-type data
  * Fixed handling of Excel 2003 dates in `pandas.io.parsers`
  * `DateRange` caching was happening with high resolution `DateOffset` objects,
    e.g. `DateOffset(seconds=1)`. This has been fixed
  * Fixed __truediv__ issue in `DataFrame`
  * Fixed `DataFrame.toCSV` bug preventing IO round trips in some cases
  * Fixed bug in `Series.plot` causing matplotlib to barf in exceptional cases
  * Disabled `Index` objects from being hashable, like ndarrays
  * Added `__ne__` implementation to `Index` so that operations like ts[ts != idx]
    will work
  * Added `__ne__` implementation to `DataFrame`
  * Bug / unintuitive result when calling `fillna` on unordered labels
  * Bug calling `sum` on boolean DataFrame
  * Bug fix when creating a DataFrame from a dict with scalar values
  * Series.{sum, mean, std, ...} now return NA/NaN when the whole Series is NA
  * NumPy 1.4 through 1.6 compatibility fixes
  * Fixed bug in bias correction in `rolling_cov`, was affecting `rolling_corr`
    too
  * R-square value was incorrect in the presence of fixed and time effects in
    the `PanelOLS` classes
  * `HDFStore` can handle duplicates in table format, will take
